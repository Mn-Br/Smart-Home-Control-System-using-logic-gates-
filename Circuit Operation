This circuit operates when the Door Button is 1, so it is considered as an Enable button.
When it is 1, that means that the person is in the home. Then, the lights will be 1 (tuned on). 
Time value 1 means day time and 0 means night time.
Temp is a shortcut to Temperature. When it is 1 that means it is above the specific value (a certain value of the temperature that is set by the admin). When it is 0 that means it is under that value.
If Temp is 1 so the AC will be 1 (turned on) and vice versa.
When Time is 1 the Curtains and the Coffee Maker will be 1 (curtains are opened, coffee maker starts operating). When it is 0, neither will work.
